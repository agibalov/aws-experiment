# gradle-aws-plugin-experiment

A demo project that illustrates how to implement an opinionated AWS CloudFormation deployment tool with Gradle and [gradle-aws-plugin](https://github.com/classmethod/gradle-aws-plugin). The goal is to understand whether these things are better to be built with bash ([example](https://github.com/loki2302/aws-experiment/blob/master/aws-lambda-experiment/tool.sh)) or with Gradle.
